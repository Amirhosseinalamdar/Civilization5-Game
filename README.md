We implemented [Civilization 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V) using object oriented programming and MVC model in java ([phase 1 UML chart](https://github.com/Amirhosseinalamdar/Civilization5-Game/blob/main/UML.jpg)) and we used javafx for graphics.
In the third phase, we divided our project to server and client using Socket Programming in Java.

(you can run several instances and log-in as different users and invite each other to a game and play. 
this game is turn-based so each user will play on their turn.)
